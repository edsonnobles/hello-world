# hello-world
Hello, people from earth!

I am from a planet not so far distant. Although, it has not yet been discovered by humans. That's because our technology is far beyond yours. Anyway, that's not the point here... The point is... I'm just kidding... Smile!

Let's get to business.

I am a computer science student. I'm not the one most genius, still, I'm trying to get better as do all of you out there, isn't it?!
My goal is to learn enough to contribute to something that really matters and that will help people and our planet.

I took two classes of programming at university, in whiches we used Java. As always it was not to learn Java but to learn the basics of programming. So, I bought an online Java course (beginner to advanced) and an online PHP course (beginner to advanced) from Softblue. 

I am also currently enroled on CS50's Introduction to Computer Science by Harvard University from edX, Introduction to Python: Absolute Beginner by Microsoft from edX, Circuits and Electronics 1: Basic Circuit Analysis and Designing Health Information Systems by MIT from edX, and Machine Learning by Stanford University from Coursera.

As you can see, I am in love with edX platform. I've always wished to get into one of those big universities and edX just made it possible and affordable, big thanks for that!

My interests are Health Care, Clean Energy, Robotics and A.I.

That's all, be kind, be empathic, be honest, be humble and most of all be happy!

Thanks for your time.
Kind regards,

Edson.
