Programming exercises

Hello, people from earth!

I am from a planet not so far distant. Althought, it has not yet being discovered by humans. That's because our technology is far better then yours. Anyway, that's not the point here... The point is... I'm just kidding! Don't get mad, please.

Let's get to business.

I am a computer science student. Not the most genious though, still I'm trying get better as do all of you, isn't it?!
My goal is to learn enough to contribute to something that really matters and that will help people and our planet.

I took two classes of programming at university, which we used Java. As always it was not to learn Java, but to learn the basics of programing. So, I bought a online Java course (beginning to advanced) and a online PHP course (beggining to advanced) from Softblue. 

I am also currently enroled on CS50's Introduction to Computer Science by Harvard University from edX, Introduction to Python: Absolute Beginner by Microsoft from edX, Circuits and Electronics 1: Basic Circuit Analysis and Designing Health Information Systems by MIT from edX, and Machine Learning by Stanford University from coursera.

As you can see, I am in love with edX plataform. I've always wished to get into one of those big universities and edX just made it possible and affordable, big thanks for that!

My interests are: Heath Care, Clear Energy, Robotics and A.I..

Thanks for your time.
Kind regards,

Edson.
